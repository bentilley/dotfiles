# CTAGS Config Directory

## How to use

This directory is sym linked to "\$HOME/.ctags.d".

Files in this directory need to be of the format `*.ctags`. They will be read
in alphabetical order. See `man ctags` for more info.

### Unused

Place any config files that you do not want to be loaded into the `unused`
directory. This will not be loaded and is a good place to put ideas and works
in progress.
