# Colors Directory

These files are used to get different colors by using the “:colorscheme” command.

When you run `:colorscheme` it loads color scheme {name}. This searches
'runtimepath' for the file "colors/{name}.vim". The first one that is found is
loaded. Also searches all plugins in 'packpath', first below "start" and then
under "opt".
